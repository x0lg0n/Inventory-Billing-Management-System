# Project Governance

This document describes the governance model for the Inventory & Billing Management System project.

## Overview

The Inventory & Billing Management System project is led by a team of maintainers who are responsible for the overall direction of the project, feature development, and community management. The project follows an open governance model where decisions are made transparently with input from the community.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Contributors

Contributors are community members who contribute to the project in any way. This includes:

- Submitting pull requests
- Reporting bugs
- Suggesting features
- Participating in discussions
- Improving documentation
- Helping other users

Anyone can become a contributor by interacting with the project in any of these ways.

### Maintainers

Maintainers are experienced contributors who have demonstrated commitment to the project and have been granted write access to the repository. Their responsibilities include:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Triaging issues
- Ensuring code quality and consistency
- Maintaining project infrastructure
- Participating in project planning
- Mentoring new contributors

Maintainers are expected to:

- Act in the best interests of the project
- Foster a collaborative and inclusive environment
- Follow established processes and guidelines
- Participate regularly in project maintenance

### Project Lead

The Project Lead is responsible for:

- Setting the overall vision and direction for the project
- Making final decisions when consensus cannot be reached
- Coordinating releases
- Representing the project in public forums
- Managing the maintainer team

The Project Lead is currently Siddhartha Kunwar.

## Decision Making

### Consensus-Based Process

The project operates on a consensus-seeking model. Decisions are made by:

1. **Discussion**: Proposals are discussed openly in GitHub issues or discussions
2. **Feedback**: Community members provide feedback and suggestions
3. **Consensus**: The team seeks agreement from active maintainers
4. **Implementation**: Once consensus is reached, changes are implemented

### Voting

If consensus cannot be reached on a significant decision, maintainers may vote. Each maintainer gets one vote. Simple majority wins. The Project Lead has a deciding vote in case of ties.

Voting is typically reserved for:

- Major architectural changes
- Addition/removal of maintainers
- Changes to governance model
- Release decisions in exceptional circumstances

## Becoming a Maintainer

New maintainers are invited based on:

- Consistent, high-quality contributions to the project
- Understanding of the project's codebase and architecture
- Positive interactions with the community
- Reliability in reviewing pull requests
- Commitment to the project's future

The process for adding maintainers:

1. Existing maintainers nominate candidates
2. Discussion among maintainers
3. Consensus or vote to invite candidate
4. Invitation extended to candidate
5. Candidate accepts invitation and gains write access

## Removing Maintainers

Maintainers may be removed for:

- Extended inactivity (typically > 6 months with no communication)
- Violation of the Code of Conduct
- Actions that harm the project

The process:

1. Private discussion among other maintainers
2. Attempt to address concerns with the maintainer
3. If unresolved, consensus or vote to remove maintainer
4. Removal of write access and maintainer status

## Release Process

### Versioning

The project follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

- MAJOR version for incompatible API changes
- MINOR version for backward-compatible functionality
- PATCH version for backward-compatible bug fixes

### Release Cadence

- Patch releases: As needed for critical bug fixes
- Minor releases: Quarterly (approximately)
- Major releases: As needed for breaking changes

### Release Manager

Each release has a designated release manager who is responsible for:

- Coordinating the release process
- Ensuring quality assurance
- Preparing release notes
- Publishing the release

The release manager rotates among maintainers.

## Communication

### Public Forums

- GitHub Issues: Bug reports and feature requests
- GitHub Discussions: General discussion and questions
- Pull Requests: Code reviews and collaboration

### Private Communication

Private communication among maintainers happens through:

- Private GitHub discussions (when needed)
- Email for sensitive matters

All project decisions should ultimately be documented in public forums.

## Changes to Governance

Changes to this governance document require:

1. Proposal in a GitHub issue
2. Discussion period of at least two weeks
3. Consensus among maintainers or majority vote
4. Documentation of the change

## Acknowledgements

This governance model is inspired by successful open-source projects and adapted to fit the needs of the Inventory & Billing Management System community.
